# AGP+ v2.2.1 - Architecture Optimization Session

**Project:** AGP+ (Ambulatory Glucose Profile Plus)  
**Current Version:** 2.2.1-dev (architecture improvements)  
**Status:** üî® In Progress - Phase 1 Complete  
**Date:** October 25, 2025  
**GitHub:** https://github.com/jllmostert/agp-plus-v2  
**Dev Server:** http://localhost:3001 (was 5173, port changed)

---

## üéØ QUICK CONTEXT

**What we're doing:** Optimizing architecture before v3.0 development  
**Why:** Found architectural violations during code review  
**Priority:** Fix separation of concerns (components vs hooks vs engines)

**Latest commit:** `009af20` - "refactor: extract day profiles logic to useDayProfiles hook"

## üìã PROGRESS TRACKER

### ‚úÖ PHASE 1: Code Refactoring (COMPLETE)
- [x] Task 1.1: Architectural review
- [x] Task 1.2: Create `useDayProfiles` hook
- [x] Task 1.3: Refactor AGPGenerator to use new hook
- [x] Task 1.4: Test day profiles functionality
- [x] Task 1.5: ~~Extract Y-axis calculation~~ (SKIPPED - optional)
- [x] Task 1.6: ~~Move average duration calc~~ (SKIPPED - optional)
- [x] Task 1.7: Commit refactoring changes

**What we fixed:**
- ‚ùå VIOLATION: AGPGenerator was calling engines directly in `handleDayProfilesOpen`
- ‚úÖ SOLUTION: Created `useDayProfiles` hook at `/src/hooks/useDayProfiles.js`
- ‚úÖ RESULT: AGPGenerator now just calls hook, no business logic in component

### ‚è≥ PHASE 2: Documentation & Comments (NOT STARTED)
- [ ] Task 2.1: Add JSDoc to useDayProfiles (ALREADY DONE in creation)
- [ ] Task 2.2: Add inline comments to Y-axis algorithm
- [ ] Task 2.3: Document badge thresholds in code
- [ ] Task 2.4: Update PROJECT_BRIEFING with new hook
- [ ] Task 2.5: Commit documentation updates

### ‚è≥ PHASE 3: v3.0 Planning (NOT STARTED)
- [ ] Task 3.1: Read ROADMAP_v3.0.md
- [ ] Task 3.2: Explain branching strategy (main + v3.0-dev)
- [ ] Task 3.3: Answer sensor database integration questions
- [ ] Task 3.4: Create v3.0 development plan

### ‚è≥ PHASE 4: Final Handoff (NOT STARTED)
- [ ] Task 4.1: This document (IN PROGRESS)
- [ ] Task 4.2: Document progress state
- [ ] Task 4.3: List remaining TODOs
- [ ] Task 4.4: Save to project directory

## üìö ESSENTIAL DOCUMENTATION

**Primary docs** (in /mnt/project/):
- `PROJECT_BRIEFING_V2_2_0_PART1.md` - Architecture & algorithms
- `PROJECT_BRIEFING_V2_2_0_PART2.md` - File responsibilities
- `MASTER_INDEX_V2_2_0.md` - Quick reference
- `HANDOFF_PROMPT_V2_2_0.md` - Previous handoff (pre-refactoring)

**This session's analysis:**
- Architectural review completed (see chat history)
- Found 3 violations: 1 critical (fixed), 2 minor (optional)

## üîß KEY FILES MODIFIED

### New Files Created:
```
src/hooks/useDayProfiles.js (94 lines)
‚îú‚îÄ Extracts day profile generation from AGPGenerator
‚îú‚îÄ Calls getLastSevenDays from day-profile-engine
‚îú‚îÄ Enriches profiles with AGP overlay data
‚îî‚îÄ Fully documented with JSDoc
```

### Files Modified:
```
src/components/AGPGenerator.jsx
‚îú‚îÄ Added import: useDayProfiles
‚îú‚îÄ Changed: dayProfiles from useState to hook call
‚îú‚îÄ Simplified: handleDayProfilesOpen (50+ lines ‚Üí 15 lines)
‚îî‚îÄ Removed: All engine imports and calculations
```

## üöÄ NEXT STEPS

### Immediate (This Session):
1. **Phase 2 tasks** - Add inline comments to complex algorithms
2. **Phase 3 tasks** - Plan v3.0 branching and sensor DB integration
3. **Phase 4 tasks** - Create final handoff for next session

### Future Sessions:
1. **v2.2.1 Release** - Document architectural improvements in CHANGELOG
2. **v3.0 Development** - Start incremental storage implementation
3. **Optional Refactoring** - Y-axis utils, average duration in engine

---

## üí° REMAINING ARCHITECTURAL CONCERNS

**Minor violations (can fix later):**
1. `DayProfileCard.jsx` lines 187-253 - Y-axis calculation inline (140 lines)
   - **Argument for:** It's visualization logic, maybe belongs in component
   - **Argument against:** Used in 3 places, should be DRY in utils
   - **Decision:** Defer to Jo

2. `HypoglycemiaEvents.jsx` lines 29-40 - Average duration calculation
   - **Argument for:** Simple math, not worth engine complexity
   - **Argument against:** Inconsistent with "all calcs in engines" principle
   - **Decision:** Defer to Jo

**Project location:** `/Users/jomostert/Documents/Projects/agp-plus/`  
**Always use full absolute paths** - no ~ or relative paths

## üìû IF CHAT FILLS UP

**Create new chat and:**
1. Read THIS document first (lightweight context)
2. Check PROGRESS TRACKER to see where we left off
3. Continue from next unchecked task
4. Reference full PROJECT_BRIEFING docs only when needed

**Key context:**
- v2.2.0 is production-ready
- We're doing architecture cleanup before v3.0
- Phase 1 refactoring is COMPLETE
- Phases 2-4 remain

---
