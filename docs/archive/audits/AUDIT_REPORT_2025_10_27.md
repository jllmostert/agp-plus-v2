### PROJECT_BRIEFING Recommendations:

**Immediate Improvements (High Impact):**

1. **Rewrite Mission Statement (30 min):**
   ```markdown
   ## 🎯 MISSION
   
   AGP+ empowers people with diabetes and their clinical teams to make data-driven 
   decisions through brutalist clarity. By transforming 28,000+ continuous glucose 
   readings into actionable insights—spanning years, not days—we reveal patterns 
   that save lives and improve outcomes.
   
   **What Makes This Different:**
   - Multi-year analysis (not just 14-day snapshots)
   - Sensor-aware insights (correlate patterns with device changes)
   - Print-optimized for clinical workflows (brutalist design = clarity)
   - Zero vendor lock-in (client-side, privacy-first)
   ```

2. **Add Troubleshooting Decision Trees (1 hour):**
   Create "Common Problems & Solutions" section with flowcharts:
   - "Data not loading" → Check IndexedDB → Check console → Check date range
   - "Slow performance" → Check cache → Check dataset size → Optimize query
   - "Sensor lines missing" → Check database → Check date match → Check SVG render

3. **Add Success Criteria to Roadmap (30 min):**
   For each phase, add:
   - ✅ Done when: [specific, testable criteria]
   - 📊 Metrics: [performance targets, functionality checklist]
   - ⏱️ Effort: [estimated days/hours]
   - 🎯 Target: [Q4 2025, etc.]

4. **Add Implementation Walkthrough (2 hours):**
   Pick one feature (e.g., "Add Weekly Summary") and document:
   - Initial requirement
   - Design decisions (which layer, why)
   - Implementation (actual code with comments)
   - Testing procedure
   - Commit message example
   - What could go wrong

5. **Add "Why This Approach" Sections (1 hour):**
   Throughout document, add boxes explaining rationale:
   ```markdown
   **🤔 Why Month Bucketing?**
   - Natural CSV boundary (CareLink exports by month)
   - Balances bucket size vs query speed
   - Typical analysis: 1-3 months (fast query)
   - Full history: 30+ months (still manageable)
   - Trade-off: Cross-month queries need 2-3 fetches (acceptable)
   ```

**Medium-Term Enhancements:**
1. Add architectural decision records (ADRs)
2. Include test coverage documentation
3. Add browser compatibility matrix
4. Document performance benchmarks with methodology
5. Create visual system overview (one-page architecture diagram)

**The Verdict:**
This project is **production-ready** with minor polish needed. With 1-2 weeks of focused cleanup and enhancement (following the roadmap below), AGP+ will have world-class documentation AND implementation.

The foundation is exceptional. The technical decisions are sound. The execution is disciplined. Now it's time to elevate PROJECT_BRIEFING from "technically complete" to "inspiring confidence"—that's the final 10% that makes documentation truly *geweldig goed*.

**Recommended Next Steps:**
1. Week 1: Execute all P1 items (console cleanup, version audit, PROJECT_BRIEFING enhancement)
2. Week 2: Execute high-value P2 items (bug fixes, file cleanup)
3. Week 3: Phase 3 completion (known bugs resolved)
4. Week 4: Phase 4 planning with enhanced documentation

**Final Score: 8.5/10** - Excellent work, with clear path to 9.5/10.
