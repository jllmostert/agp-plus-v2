fix(metrics): Day profiles now work in V3 mode (fullDatasetRange)

- Fix MetricsContext to use fullDatasetRange || dateRange
- Resolves undefined dateRange in V3 IndexedDB mode  
- Day profiles modal now displays all 7-day cards correctly
- Maintains backwards compatibility with V2 legacy CSV mode

Bug: useDayProfiles received undefined dateRange in V3 mode
Root cause: V3 uses fullDatasetRange, not dateRange
Fix: Fallback pattern fullDatasetRange || dateRange

Tested: ✅ V3 mode (7 profiles displayed)
Verified: Toggle 7/14 days, metrics, curves, events all working
