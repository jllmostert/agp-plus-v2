# HANDOFF - Phase 5C Sensor Sync System Complete

Date: 2025-10-31 10:20 CET  
Status: READY FOR TESTING  
Latest Changes: Smart sensor sync to localStorage  
Server: Running on port 3011 (multiple port conflicts - needs cleanup)

---

## WHAT WAS DONE THIS SESSION

### Phase 5C: Smart Sensor Sync System

**Problem Solved:**
Sensors from CSV detection were only in memory → DELETE operations failed with "Sensor niet gevonden"

**Solution Implemented:**
Smart sync system that copies unlocked sensors to localStorage at startup:

1. **At app startup** (`useSensorDatabase` hook):
   - Load all sensors from SQLite database
   - Detect any CSV sensors
   - Merge all sensors in memory
   - **NEW:** Call `syncUnlockedSensorsToLocalStorage(allSensors)`

2. **Sync function** (`sensorStorage.js`):
   - Filter sensors ≤30 days old (unlocked, "workable")
   - Convert SQLite format → localStorage format
   - Add to localStorage database (skip duplicates)
   - Log sync results to console

3. **Result:**
   - All recent sensors in localStorage (DELETE works)
   - Old sensors stay in SQLite (protected, read-only)
   - Manual lock system works (Phase 5B)
   - One sync point = simple architecture

---

## CODE CHANGES

### File: `src/storage/sensorStorage.js`

**Lines 169-185 - Enhanced sync function:**
```javascript
// Convert SQLite format to localStorage format before storing
const localStorageFormat = {
  sensor_id: sensor.sensor_id,
  start_date: sensor.start_date,
  end_date: sensor.end_date || null,
  lot_number: sensor.lot_number || null,
  hw_version: sensor.hw_version || null,
  notes: sensor.notes || '',
  reason_stop: sensor.failure_reason || null
};

db.sensors.push(localStorageFormat);
```

**Key improvement:**  
Now properly converts sensor structure instead of pushing raw SQLite format

## TESTING STATUS

âš  **NOT YET TESTED** - Needs fresh browser session

### Test Plan:

**Test 1: Sync at Startup**
- Open app with clean cache
- Check console: Should see sync messages
- Expected: "Added X unlocked sensors to localStorage"

**Test 2: DELETE Recent Sensor**
- Open Sensor History modal
- Find sensor <30 days old (unlocked)
- Click DELETE → Should work

**Test 3: DELETE Old Sensor (Locked)**
- Find sensor >30 days old (locked 🔒)
- Click DELETE → Should show lock error
- Click lock icon to unlock
- Click DELETE again → Should work now

**Test 4: Persistence**
- Make some changes (delete, toggle locks)
- Reload browser
- Check: All changes persisted

---

## SYSTEM STATUS

### Git
- âŒ Not committed yet
- Changes: sensorStorage.js (1 function updated)

### Server  
- Running on port **3011** (not 3001)
- Reason: Multiple lingering Vite processes
- Need: Better cleanup process

### Browser
- Multiple Chrome tabs open (3001-3011)
- Recommendation: Close all, start fresh

### Data
- 220 sensors in SQLite database
- Manual lock system initialized
- Sync system ready to test

---

## ARCHITECTURE NOTES

### The Elegant Solution

**Old Problem:**
```
Sensors from 3 sources:
1. SQLite database (historical, >220 sensors)
2. CSV detection (new imports)
3. Manual adds (rare)

Problem: Only SQLite sensors in localStorage
CSV sensors: In memory only → DELETE fails
```

**New Solution:**
```
At startup, ONE sync operation:
- Filter: sensors ≤30 days old
- Convert: SQLite format → localStorage format  
- Copy: Into localStorage database
- Result: All "workable" sensors available for DELETE

Old sensors (>30 days):
- Stay in SQLite only
- Read-only, protected by locks
- Memory efficient (not loaded into localStorage)
```

### Why This Works

1. **Simple:** One sync point at startup
2. **Efficient:** Only recent sensors in localStorage
3. **Safe:** Old data protected in SQLite
4. **Complete:** DELETE works on all unlocked sensors

---

## FILE STRUCTURE

### Modified Files:
```
src/storage/sensorStorage.js
  - Lines 169-185: Enhanced format conversion
  - Function: syncUnlockedSensorsToLocalStorage()
```

### Unchanged Files:
```
src/hooks/useSensorDatabase.js
  - Already calls syncUnlockedSensorsToLocalStorage()
  - Line 192: sync call already present (from previous session)
```

---

## NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES

### 1. CLEANUP & FRESH START
```bash
# Kill ALL Vite processes
pkill -9 -f vite
pkill -9 -f node

# Clear any lingering ports
for port in {3001..3020}; do
  lsof -ti:$port | xargs -r kill -9
done

# Start fresh on 3001
cd /Users/jomostert/Documents/Projects/agp-plus
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH"
npx vite --port 3001
```

### 2. TEST SENSOR SYNC
- [ ] Open app, check console for sync messages  
- [ ] Test DELETE on recent sensor - should work
- [ ] Test DELETE on locked sensor - should show error
- [ ] Toggle lock, test DELETE again - should work
- [ ] Reload browser - verify persistence

### 3. FIX DAGPROFIELEN GAP ISSUE
**Problem:** AGP curve draws lines through sensor gaps  
**Files:**
- `src/components/DayProfilesModal.jsx`
- AGP curve rendering logic
- Data filtering for gaps

**Approach:**
1. Identify sensor change points (gaps in data)
2. Break curve at those points (set data to null)
3. Verify with test data (sensor #10 → #11 transition)

### 4. GIT COMMIT
```bash
git add src/storage/sensorStorage.js
git commit -m "Phase 5C: Smart sensor sync to localStorage

- Convert unlocked sensors (<30 days) from SQLite to localStorage
- Proper format mapping (sensor_id, start_date, end_date, etc.)
- Enables DELETE operations on all recent sensors
- Locked sensors stay protected in read-only SQLite database"
git push origin main
```

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: Port Conflicts
**Symptoms:** Vite starts on port 3011, 3012, etc.  
**Cause:** Multiple node/vite processes lingering  
**Fix:** Use `pkill -9 -f vite` before starting

### Issue: DELETE Still Fails
**Check:**
1. Console: Did sync run? Look for "[syncUnlockedSensors]" messages
2. localStorage: Inspect `agp-sensor-database` key - are sensors there?
3. Sensor age: Is sensor actually <30 days old?
4. Lock state: Is sensor unlocked (🔓)?

### Issue: No Sync Messages in Console
**Possible causes:**
1. SQLite database not loading
2. No sensors <30 days old in database
3. Sync function error (check error logs)

## CRITICAL REMINDERS

1. **Test fresh:** Close all Chrome tabs, start from scratch
2. **Check console:** Sync messages = proof it works
3. **Port cleanup:** Use pkill before server start
4. **Git commit:** Don't forget to commit before next session!
