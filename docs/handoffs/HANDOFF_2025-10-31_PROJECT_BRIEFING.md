### 2. Status Document Updated ✅

**File**: `project/STATUS.md` (257 lines)

**Contents**:
- Current v3.10.0 phase (testing)
- All 5 bug fixes summarized
- Testing checklist (what still needs validation)
- Known issues with priority levels
- Next steps (v3.10 release → v3.11 hardening)
- Performance metrics
- Definition of Done checklist

---

### 3. Phase 2 Architecture Hardening Explained

**What it is**: Eliminate 4 structural weaknesses in dual-storage architecture

**The 4 Problems** (7-9 hours total):

1. **Time Boundary Drift** (1-2h)
   - Problem: Sensors >30d stay in localStorage (should be SQLite-only)
   - Fix: Auto-prune localStorage sensors on mount
   
2. **Lock Status Orphaning** (1h)
   - Problem: Manual lock choices lost after 30-day boundary
   - Fix: Persistent lock-metadata store
   
3. **Resurrection via localStorage.clear()** (2h)
   - Problem: Deleted sensors respawn if localStorage wiped
   - Fix: Dual persistence (localStorage + SQLite deleted_sensors table)
   
4. **Persistent UUID** (3h)
   - Problem: Chronological #ID changes after delete
   - Fix: Add UUID, use for operations, #ID display only

**Priority**: Medium (not blocking v3.10 release, but needed for long-term stability)

## 🎯 CURRENT PROJECT STATE

### v3.10.0 Status: Testing Phase

**What's Done**:
- ✅ 5 critical bugs fixed (duplicates, lock system, delete)
- ✅ All code committed & pushed (commit: 5d22534)
- ✅ Complete documentation (briefing + status)
- ✅ Phase 2 roadmap defined

**What's Next**:
- 🧪 User validation testing (see checklist below)
- 📝 Update CHANGELOG.md with v3.10.0 entry
- 🏷️ Git tag: `v3.10.0-sensor-stability`
- 🚀 Release v3.10.0

**Blockers**: None (ready for testing)

---

## 🧪 TESTING CHECKLIST (User Validation)

### Priority 1: Duplicate Fix
- [ ] Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R)
- [ ] Check console: "duplicatesRemoved: X"
- [ ] Import CSV → verify count correct (4 confirmed = 4 added)
- [ ] Delete sensor → stays deleted after refresh

### Priority 2: Lock System
- [ ] Old sensors (>30d): Show 🔒 icon
- [ ] Recent sensors (≤30d): Show 🔓 icon
- [ ] Toggle lock: works on recent, errors on old
- [ ] Delete button: disabled when locked, shows "🔒 DEL"

### Priority 3: CSV Import
- [ ] Ignore 4, Confirm 4 → only 4 added
- [ ] Toast shows correct count
- [ ] No duplicates after reload

**See FIXES_IMPLEMENTED.md for complete test details**

---

## 🚨 KNOWN ISSUES (Not Fixed Yet)

**Phase 2 will address**:
1. Time Boundary Drift (sensors >30d linger in localStorage)
2. Lock Status Orphaning (manual locks lost after 30d)
3. Resurrection Bug (deleted sensors respawn after localStorage.clear())
4. Chronological Index Instability (#ID changes after delete)

**Impact**: Low (cosmetic/edge cases, doesn't break core functionality)

---

## 📋 NEXT SESSION ACTIONS

### Option A: Complete v3.10.0 Release

**If testing passes**:
1. [ ] All test cases validated (see checklist above)
2. [ ] Update CHANGELOG.md with v3.10.0 entry
3. [ ] Git tag: `v3.10.0-sensor-stability`
4. [ ] Update agp-project-status.html
5. [ ] Handoff for Phase 2 prep

**Estimated time**: 1 hour

---

### Option B: Start Phase 2 (Architecture Hardening)

**If v3.10 validated and released**:
1. [ ] Time Boundary Enforcement (1-2h)
2. [ ] Persistent Lock Metadata (1h)
3. [ ] Tombstone Resilience (2h)
4. [ ] Persistent UUID System (3h)

**Estimated time**: 7-9 hours total
