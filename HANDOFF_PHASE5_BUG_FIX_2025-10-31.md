## WHAT WAS DONE

### Bug Fixed: Delete Operations
Problem: Delete functionality completely broken
- Error: "Sensor niet gevonden"
- Error: "undefined dagen oud" in dialogs

Root Cause: Parameter mismatch
- Function expected: sensor_id
- Code was passing: start_date

Solution: Fixed 2 lines in SensorHistoryModal.jsx
- Line 773: Force delete now uses sensor.sensor_id
- Line 784: Normal delete now uses sensor.sensor_id

Commit: 79baa9b
Files: src/components/SensorHistoryModal.jsx (2 line changes)

## CURRENT STATE

Git: main branch, pushed to remote
Server: Not running (needs restart)
Browser: Chrome tab at localhost:3001 (needs reload)

System Status:
- 220 sensors in database
- Phase 5 lock system integrated
- TDD metrics: 27.9E ± 5.4 SD
- Data quality: 94.0%

---

## NEXT SESSION TASKS

1. RESTART SERVER:
   cd /Users/jomostert/Documents/Projects/agp-plus
   export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH"
   lsof -ti:3001 | xargs kill -9
   npx vite --port 3001

2. OPEN CHROME:
   http://localhost:3001
   Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R)

3. TEST DELETE FUNCTIONALITY:
   - Open Sensor History modal
   - Try deleting old sensor (>30 days)
   - Verify lock warning appears
   - Test force override
   - Try deleting new sensor (<30 days)
   - Verify normal delete works

4. REPORT FINDINGS:
   - Does lock status show correct age?
   - Do delete operations complete?
   - Any console errors?
   - Any UI glitches?

## FILES MODIFIED THIS SESSION

src/components/SensorHistoryModal.jsx
- Changed sensor.start_date to sensor.sensor_id in delete calls
- Lines 773, 784

Backup available: src/components/SensorHistoryModal.jsx.backup

## CODE REFERENCE

Lock System Functions (sensorStorage.js):
- isSensorLocked(startDate) → boolean
- getSensorLockStatus(startDate) → {isLocked, daysOld, threshold}
- deleteSensorWithLockCheck(sensor_id, force) → {success, message, wasLocked}
- getLockStatistics() → {total, locked, unlocked, percentage}

Delete Flow (SensorHistoryModal.jsx):
1. User clicks DELETE button
2. Check: getSensorLockStatus(sensor.start_date)
3. If locked: Show force override dialog
4. Call: deleteSensorWithLockCheck(sensor.sensor_id, force)
5. Handle result: success or error message

---

## KNOWN GOOD STATE

Before this fix:
- Everything worked EXCEPT delete operations
- Lock icons displayed correctly
- Lock detection worked correctly
- Only delete calls failed (wrong parameter)

After this fix:
- Delete calls should now find sensors correctly
- Lock warnings should show correct age
- Force override should work
- Normal delete should work

---

## TESTING SCENARIOS

Scenario 1: Delete Locked Sensor
1. Find sensor with start_date >30 days ago
2. Click DELETE
3. Should see: "Deze sensor is XX dagen oud"
4. Click OK (force override)
5. Should see: "Sensor GEFORCEERD verwijderd"
6. Sensor should be removed from table

Scenario 2: Delete Unlocked Sensor
1. Find sensor with start_date <30 days ago
2. Click DELETE
3. Should see normal confirmation (no lock warning)
4. Click OK
5. Should see: "Sensor verwijderd"
6. Sensor should be removed from table

Scenario 3: Cancel Delete
1. Click DELETE on any sensor
2. Click Cancel
3. Nothing should happen
4. Sensor should remain in table

---

## TROUBLESHOOTING

If delete still fails:
- Check console: sensor.sensor_id exists?
- Check console: deleteSensorWithLockCheck imported?
- Hard refresh browser
- Verify Vite compiled changes
- Check git status: changes committed?

If lock status wrong:
- Verify current date
- Check sensor.start_date format
- Console.log getSensorLockStatus output
- Verify 30-day threshold calculation
